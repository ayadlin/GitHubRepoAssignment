Create a new repository on GITHUB and call it GitHubRepoAssignment


Open your terminal/command prompt, and create a GitHubRepoAssignment folder
mkdir GitHubRepoAssignment

Initialize a git repository in your GitHubRepoAssignment directory
cd GitHubRepoAssignment/
git init

Make a readme.md in your GitHubRepoAssignment folder explaining its contents.
touch readme.md
atom readme.md ---edit file---
Do a status check to see the changes made, then add, commit and push you changes

git status
git add .
git commit -m"added readme.md file"
git remote add origin git@github.com:ayadlin/GitHubRepoAssignment.git
git push -u origin master

Upload your GitHubRepoAssignment.txt file that outlines the steps you took
